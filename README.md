# Parking-lot

- Each instance of a ParkingLot must have a way of knowing how many spaces it has left for each kind of car (Large, Medium, and Small).

- The ParkingLot class must have a Constructor that requires the caller to specify how many of each kind of car the Parking Lot can hold (Large, Medium, and Small).

- The ParkingLot class must have a method public bool AddCar(string carType). The carType will be either "Large", "Medium", or "Small". The AddCar method must return either true or false depending on whether or not there are still spaces for the requested car size.
